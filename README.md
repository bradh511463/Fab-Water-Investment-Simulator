# Fab-Water-Investment-Simulator

## What it is:
This project was built to help evaluate the tradeoffs between Water Investment for Wafer Fabrications centers to their ultimate financial goals. Can alignment exist where because of the investments made that fabrication centers become more profitable?  To answer that question the goal was to develop an interactive decision-support dashboard that models this systemic relationship. Rather than merely optimizing for cost or water savings, the system enables users to explore the dynamic trade-offs between investment in water-efficient technologies and financial outcomes delivering both business rationale and sustainability alignment

## To Run:
Ensure that you are running from the main directory of Fab-Water-Investment Simulator. To run correctly v7_4_roi_streamliy.py, v7_4_cas_st.py, and v7_1_streamlit.py need to be in same directory. 

v7_4_roi_streamlit.py= File host all the logic that drives the top part of the dashboard. It connects to ML model ROI Multiplier to bring in Wafer Intention logic, host the formulas which are driven by the boosted.csv file.
